Jot-A-Thought is a simple Android app created in Java and developed by a team of four (Dallen, Jermery, Jales, and Andrew) to allow our users to have a place to share their thoughts a have a place to write them down and view them as they desire. Jot-A-Thought is a sort of Journal/Notepad type of app where users can write and save text, and even upload pictures from their gallery and have them saved to internal storage. The app is PIN protected, and even has an accurate timestamp system in place to know exactly when the last edit to any given file was made. For those of you who prefer darkmode, you can simply toggle that with the click of a button.
